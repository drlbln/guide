## Update English text to lokalise
On every commit on the `master` branch, we upload the English texts automatically to lokalise.

## Update translations from lokalise
To import all the translations from lokalise, run the following command in the root directory of this repository.

```console
$ ./import-translations.sh <LOKALISE_TOKEN>
```

You can get the `LOKALISE_TOKEN` from https://app.lokalise.com/profile, API tokens.

This command will generate the `_translations/<LANG>.json` files and the `_content/<LANG>`. Then you will need to commit the desired changes.

**NOTE:** All the changes to translations files should be done in lokalise and then imported by the described method.
